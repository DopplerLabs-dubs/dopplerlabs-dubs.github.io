<p>Doppler administers and operates the Platform from the United States. Although the Platform may be accessible in many territories throughout the world, not all features, products, or services discussed, referenced, provided, or offered through or on the Platform are available to all persons or in all geographic locations, or appropriate or available for use outside the United States. Doppler reserves the right to limit, in its sole discretion, the provision and quantity of any feature, product, or service to any person or geographic area. Any offer or feature, product, or service made available on or via the Platform is void where prohibited. This Agreement is intended to cover use of the Platform, and all related features, products, and services, by residents of the United States and is governed by United States’ laws, which may not be as comprehensive as those in your country. If you choose to access the Platform from outside the United States, you do so on your own initiative and you are solely responsible for complying with applicable local laws.</p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">10. Children</strong></p>
<p>The Platform is not directed toward children under 13 years of age nor does Doppler knowingly collect information from children under 13. If you are under 13, please do not submit any personally identifiable information to Doppler.</p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">11. Disclaimer of Warranties</strong></p>
<p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE PLATFORM IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS FOR YOUR USE, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, ACCURACY OF DATA, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND THOSE ARISING FROM COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE. DOPPLER MAKES NO WARRANTY AS TO THE ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS, OR RELIABILITY OF ANY CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH, OR THE PERFORMANCE OF, THE PLATFORM. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR VERIFYING ANY INFORMATION BEFORE RELYING ON IT. USE OF THE PLATFORM IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. DOPPLER DOES NOT WARRANTY: (I) THAT YOU WILL BE ABLE TO ACCESS OR USE THE PLATFORM AT THE TIMES OR LOCATIONS OF YOUR CHOOSING; (II) THAT THE PLATFORM WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE; (III) THAT DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED; OR (IV) THAT THE PLATFORM IS FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS.</p>
<p>Because some states, territories, and/or jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of implied warranties, the foregoing disclaimer may not apply to you.</p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">12. Limitation of Liability.</strong></p>
<p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, DOPPLER, ITS AFFILIATES, LICENSORS, AND BUSINESS PARTNERS (COLLECTIVELY, THE “DOPPLER AFFILIATES”), DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE AND FURTHER DISCLAIMS ALL LOSSES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR SPECIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE PLATFORM AND/OR PRODUCTS, EVEN IF DOPPLER AND/OR THE DOPPLER AFFILIATES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBLITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, IN NO CASE SHALL THE LIABILITY OF DOPPLER OR ANY OF THE DOPPLER AFFILIATES EXCEED THE LESSER OF (I) US $100.00 OR (II) THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US FOR PRODUCTS PURCHASED THROUGH THE PLATFORM DURING THE SIX (6) MONTHS PRIOR TO THE TIME THE CAUSE OF ACTION GIVING RISE TO THE LIABILITY AROSE.</p>
<p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, DOPPLER WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, FOR ANY LOSS, LIABILITY, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH THE PLATFORM OR THE PURCHASE OF PRODUCTS, TO THE EXTENT CAUSED BY OR RESULTING FROM (1) YOUR ACTS, DEFAULTS, OR OMISSIONS; (2) YOUR VIOLATION OF ANY TERM, CONDITION, REPRESENTATION, OR WARRANTY CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT; (3) YOUR FAILURE TO PROVIDE AN ACCURATE SHIPPING ADDRESS OR OTHER INFORMATION THAT YOU ARE ASKED TO PROVIDE IN CONNECTION WITH THE SALE OF PRODUCTS; (4) ACTS OR OMISSIONS OF THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING THIRD PARTIES CONTRACTED BY DOPPLER; OR (5) NONDELIVERY, MISDELIVERY, OR LATE DELIVERY OF PRODUCTS OR PRODUCTS LOST OR DAMAGED IN SHIPMENT.</p>
<p>WE DO NOT IN ANY WAY EXCLUDE OR LIMIT OUR LIABILITY FOR: (A) DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY CAUSED BY OUR NEGLIGENCE OR (B) FRAUD OR FRAUDULENT MISREPRESENTATION, OR EXCLUDE OR LIMIT ANY LIABILITY WHICH CANNOT BE EXCLUDED OR LIMITED BY APPLICABLE LAW.</p>
<p>Because some states, territories, and/or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or the limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in such states, territories, and/or jurisdictions, the liability of Doppler and the Doppler affiliates shall be limited to the fullest extent permitted by law.</p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">13. Indemnification</strong></p>
<p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to indemnify, defend, and hold Doppler and the Doppler Affiliates harmless from and against any and all claims, demands, damages, or other losses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, resulting from or arising out of your use of the Platform, your negligent or intentional misuse of the Products, or any breach or alleged breach by you of this Agreement.</p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">14. General</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Governing Law; Disputes; Interpretation</em></strong></p>
<p>This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the States of New York, United States of America, without regard to conflicts of law principles. To the extent permitted by law, the parties waive all rights to trial in any action or proceeding instituted in connection with this Agreement, the Platform, the Products, and/or Doppler. The parties agree that all controversies or claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Platform, the Products, and/or Doppler shall be resolved by confidential, binding arbitration in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association and any judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Any such controversy or claim shall be arbitrated on an individual basis and shall not be consolidated in any arbitration with any claim or controversy of any other party. The arbitration will be conducted in the English language, in the city of New York, New York. If any provision of this Agreement or the application of any such provision to any person or circumstances shall be declared to be invalid, unenforceable, or void, such decision shall not have the effect of invalidating or voiding the remainder of the Agreement, it being the intent and agreement of the parties that this Agreement shall be deemed amended by modifying such provision to the extent necessary to render it valid, legal, and enforceable while preserving its intent or, if such modification is not possible, by substituting therefor another provision that is valid, legal, and enforceable so as to effectuate the original intent to the extent possible. Headings are for convenience only and shall not be used to construe the terms of this Agreement.</p>
<p><strong><em>Waiver</em></strong></p>
<p>Our failure to act with respect to a breach of this Agreement by you or others does not waive our right to act with respect to that breach or subsequent similar or other breaches.</p>
<p><strong><em>No Injunctive Relief</em></strong></p>
<p>In no event shall you seek or be entitled to rescission, injunctive, or other equitable relief or to enjoin or restrain the operation of the Platform, exploitation or other materials in connection therewith, or the sale, distribution, and other exploitation of the Products.</p>
<p><strong><em>Successors; Assignment</em></strong></p>
<p>This Agreement is binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors, heirs, executors, administrators, and permitted assigns. You may not assign or delegate this Agreement or any of the rights hereunder without Doppler’s prior written consent. Any purported assignment or delegation shall be ineffective. Doppler may freely assign or delegate all rights and obligations under this Agreement, full or partially, without notice to you. We may also substitute, by way of unilateral novation, effective upon notice to you, Doppler with any third party that assumes our rights and obligations under this Agreement.</p>
<p><strong><em>Entire Agreement</em></strong></p>
<p>You agree that this Agreement constitutes the entire understanding between you and Doppler regarding the Platform and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, whether written or oral, or whether established by custom, practice, policy, or precedent, with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. This Agreement may only be modified as set forth in Section 2 (“Changes to Terms of Use”). You may also be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use or purchase Products, third-party content, or third-party software.</p>
